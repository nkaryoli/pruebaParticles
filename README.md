# Welcome to my Portfolio

This is a website I created to showcase a bit of my skills as a full-stack developer, and so you can learn more about me. I hope you enjoy it!

## Description:

The color chosen for this project are magenta and cyan, as a way to create a fresh, harmonious and creative environment to isnpire and welcome users to explore. 
The disign is simple but dinamyc at the same time, using HTML and CSS for the overall structure of the website as well as some CSS animation and JavaScript for functionalities and animations too.
